- **Research Focus**: Understand event time distributions using violin plots to reveal process insights
- **Technical Challenge**: Handle highly skewed temporal data that traditional visualizations cannot effectively display
- **User Experience**: Provide real-time, interactive analysis capabilities for process mining researchers

### 📊 **Specific Requirements**
1. **Multi-Dataset Support**: Handle different types of process mining logs (healthcare, finance, government)
2. **Smart Data Processing**: Automatically filter out uninformative case-start events 
3. **Multiple Transformations**: Provide 7 different time transformation methods to reveal different patterns
4. **Interactive Analysis**: Real-time sorting and filtering capabilities
5. **Professional UI**: Responsive, mobile-friendly dashboard design
6. **Research Validity**: Cross-domain validation across multiple BPI Challenge datasets
7. **🆕 Dynamic Dataset Switching**: Seamless switching between 4+ datasets in real-time
8. **🆕 Configurable Event Display**: User-selectable number of top events (4-10)
9. **🆕 Integrated Multi-Domain Analysis**: Single interface for cross-domain process comparison

### 🔬 **Research Motivation**
- **Problem**: Process mining event logs typically show extreme temporal skewness (80-90% of events cluster early)
- **Challenge**: Traditional visualizations fail to reveal meaningful patterns in time-since-case-start data
- **Innovation**: Use violin plots with intelligent filtering and transformations to uncover hidden process insights

---

## 🏗️ **2. How Did You Design Your Solution?**

### 📝 **Problem Analysis**
**The Core Problem:**
- Process mining event logs contain temporal data that is extremely skewed
- Case-start events (time = 0) provide no temporal insights but dominate visualizations
- Different process domains (healthcare vs finance vs government) require different analytical approaches
- Raw time distributions often hide important process patterns

**Why This Matters:**
- Process analysts need to understand timing patterns to identify bottlenecks
- Different transformation methods reveal different aspects of process behavior
- Cross-domain validation ensures the approach works for various process types

### 🎯 **Solution Approach**

#### **1. Smart Event Filtering Strategy**
```
Traditional Approach: Include all events
❌ Result: Massive spikes at time=0, uninformative visualizations

Our Approach: Intelligent Filtering
✅ Exclude case-start events (time_since_case_start = 0)
✅ Focus on temporal events that occur after case initiation
✅ Result: Meaningful temporal pattern analysis
```

#### **2. Multi-Transformation Framework**
| **Transformation** | **Use Case** | **Mathematical Approach** |
|-------------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Logarithmic** | Highly skewed data | `log(hours + 1)` |
| **Raw Time** | Absolute timing analysis | Hours/Days/Weeks/Months |
| **Square Root** | Moderate compression | `√(hours)` |
| **Min-Max Scaling** | Cross-process comparison | `(x - min) / (max - min)` |

#### **3. Dashboard Interface & Multi-Dataset Integration**
- **Why Integrated Multi-Dataset?** Enable cross-domain process comparison in single interface
- **Dataset Management**: Real-time switching between 4 process domains without page reload
- **Configurable Analysis**: User-selectable event count (4-10) for focused or broad analysis
- **Visual Consistency**: Same analytical framework applied across all process types

#### **4. 🆕 Advanced Interactive Features**
| **Feature** | **Capability** | **Research Value** |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Dataset Selector** | Switch between 4 datasets instantly | Cross-domain pattern comparison |
| **Event Count Control** | Display top 4-10 events | Focus vs comprehensive analysis |
| **Dynamic Info Panel** | Real-time dataset statistics | Context-aware analysis |
| **Integrated Sorting** | 7 sorting methods across all datasets | Multi-dimensional process insights |

```

#### **Modular Transformation System**
```python
def transform_time_data(data, transformation_type):
    """Apply intelligent transformations based on data characteristics"""
    if transformation_type == 'log_hours':
        return np.log1p(data), "Log Hours", "Log-transformed Time Distribution"
