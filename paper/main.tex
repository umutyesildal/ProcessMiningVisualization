\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Process mining has emerged as a crucial discipline for understanding and optimizing business processes through the analysis of event logs \cite{aalst2016process}. A fundamental aspect of process analysis involves understanding the temporal distribution of events within process instances, particularly how different event types are distributed over time relative to the case start. This temporal analysis provides valuable insights into process efficiency, bottlenecks, and behavioral patterns.

This work addresses Task 10: \textit{Event type distribution over time axis}, which focuses on calculating when different event types occur on a time axis relative to the start event of sequences, sorting event types based on statistical parameters, and utilizing violin charts as the primary visual element with interactive sorting capabilities \cite{chen2015survey}.

Traditional visualization approaches for temporal process data, such as histograms and scatter plots, often fail to adequately represent the complex distributions typical in process mining datasets. These datasets frequently exhibit extreme skewness, with the majority of events clustering near the case start time, making it difficult to discern meaningful patterns in the temporal distribution.

The challenge is compounded by the presence of case-start events (events occurring at time = 0) that dominate visualizations but provide limited insights into process temporal behavior. Furthermore, different process domains exhibit varying temporal characteristics that require flexible analytical approaches to reveal domain-specific patterns.

This paper addresses these challenges by presenting an interactive dashboard that leverages violin charts for visualizing event type distributions over time. The main contributions of this work include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A smart filtering approach that removes uninformative case-start events while preserving meaningful temporal data
    \item An interactive visualization framework using violin charts with configurable statistical sorting parameters
    \item Cross-domain validation across healthcare, government, and finance process datasets
    \item A comprehensive transformation system supporting seven different time scaling methods
\end{itemize}
\section{Research Problem and Requirements}
\label{sec:problem}

\subsection{Problem Statement}

Process mining event logs typically contain temporal data that presents several visualization challenges:

\textbf{Extreme Temporal Skewness:} Most process mining datasets exhibit heavy right-tail distributions where 80-90\% of events cluster within the first few time units of case execution, making traditional visualizations ineffective.

\textbf{Case-Start Event Dominance:} Events occurring at time = 0 (case initiation events) create massive spikes in visualizations but provide no temporal insights, obscuring meaningful patterns in subsequent events.

\textbf{Cross-Domain Variability:} Different process domains (healthcare, finance, government) exhibit distinct temporal characteristics requiring adaptable analytical approaches.

\textbf{Statistical Analysis Complexity:} Understanding temporal distributions requires multiple statistical perspectives (mean, median, quartiles) that traditional visualizations cannot effectively combine.

\subsection{Requirements Analysis}

Based on the identified challenges, the following requirements were established:

\textbf{R1 - Smart Data Filtering:} The system must intelligently filter out uninformative case-start events while preserving temporal analysis validity.

\textbf{R2 - Interactive Visualization:} Provide real-time, interactive visualization capabilities using violin charts to show both distribution shape and statistical summaries.

\textbf{R3 - Configurable Sorting:} Enable users to sort event types based on different statistical parameters (minimum, maximum, mean, median, quartiles) for comprehensive analysis, as specified in the task requirements.

\textbf{R4 - Multi-Dataset Support:} Support seamless analysis across multiple process mining datasets from different domains.

\textbf{R5 - Scalability:} Maintain performance and usability across datasets ranging from thousands to millions of events.

\textbf{R6 - Transformation Flexibility:} Provide multiple time transformation methods to handle different types of temporal skewness.

\section{Design and Implementation}
\label{sec:design}

\subsection{System Architecture}

The solution implements a modular architecture comprising four main components, as detailed in Table \ref{tab:architecture}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{System Architecture Components}
\label{tab:architecture}
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Layer} & \textbf{Technology} & \textbf{Responsibility} & \textbf{Key Features} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Data Processing} & pm4py, pandas & XES ingestion, filtering & Smart filtering, validation \\
\textbf{Transformation} & NumPy, scikit-learn & Time transformations & 7 transformation methods \\
\textbf{Visualization} & Plotly, Dash & Interactive charts & Real-time updates \\
\textbf{User Interface} & HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & Web interface & Responsive design \\
\midrule
\textbf{Integration Points} & & & \\
- Data Flow & CSV $\rightarrow$ DataFrame $\rightarrow$ Visualization & Streaming pipeline \\
- User Interaction & UI Controls $\rightarrow$ Backend $\rightarrow$ Plot Update & Event-driven \\
- State Management & Session-based caching & Performance optimization \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Data Processing Layer:} Handles XES file ingestion, time calculation, and smart filtering using the pm4py library for process mining standard compliance. This layer ensures data integrity and performs initial temporal calculations.

\textbf{Transformation Engine:} Implements seven transformation methods including logarithmic scaling, raw time conversion, square root transformation, and min-max scaling to handle different distribution characteristics.

\textbf{Visualization Engine:} Built using Dash and Plotly, provides interactive violin charts with real-time updates and statistical overlay capabilities. The engine supports dynamic plot generation and user interaction handling.

\textbf{User Interface Layer:} Responsive web-based dashboard with sidebar controls for dataset selection, transformation options, sorting parameters, and event count configuration. The interface adapts to different screen sizes and input methods.

The modular design ensures maintainability, extensibility, and performance optimization across different deployment scenarios.

\subsection{Smart Filtering Algorithm}

The core innovation lies in the smart filtering approach that addresses the case-start event problem. Algorithm \ref{alg:smartfilter} provides the detailed implementation.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Smart Filtering Algorithm}
\label{alg:smartfilter}
\begin{tabular}{@{}l@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Algorithm: Smart Event Filtering} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Input:} Raw event log DataFrame $D$, number of events $n$ \\
\textbf{Output:} Filtered DataFrame $D'$, selected events $E$ \\
\\
1. \textbf{Load} event log data from CSV file \\
2. \textbf{Calculate} time\_since\_case\_start for each event \\
3. $D_{filtered} \leftarrow D[D.time\_since\_case\_start > 0]$ \\
4. \textbf{Count} event frequencies: $freq \leftarrow D_{filtered}.groupby(concept:name).count()$ \\
5. $E \leftarrow freq.head(n).index.tolist()$ \\
6. $D' \leftarrow D_{filtered}[D_{filtered}[concept:name] \in E]$ \\
7. \textbf{Validate} data integrity and temporal consistency \\
8. \textbf{Return} $D'$, $E$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This approach filters out events where \texttt{time\_since\_case\_start = 0}, focusing analysis on events that occur after case initiation and provide meaningful temporal insights.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Smart Filtering Implementation]
def load_dataset(dataset_key, num_events=6):
    df = pd.read_csv(data_path)
    
    # Smart filtering: Remove case-start events
    df_filtered = df[df['time_since_case_start'] > 0].copy()
    
    # Select top temporal events for analysis
    top_events = df_filtered['concept:name'].value_counts()
                  .head(num_events).index.tolist()
    
    # Additional validation
    if len(df_filtered) == 0:
        raise ValueError("No events after filtering")
    
    # Calculate temporal statistics
    temporal_stats = df_filtered.groupby('concept:name')
                     ['time_since_case_start'].agg(['min', 'max', 'mean', 'std'])
    
    return df_filtered, top_events, dataset_info, temporal_stats
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Transformation Framework}

Seven transformation methods were implemented to handle different temporal distribution characteristics. Table \ref{tab:transformations} details each transformation method with its mathematical formulation and use cases.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Time Transformation Methods}
\label{tab:transformations}
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Transformation} & \textbf{Formula} & \textbf{Use Case} & \textbf{Range} \\
\midrule
Logarithmic & $\log(hours + 1)$ & Highly skewed data & $[0, \infty)$ \\
Raw Hours & $hours$ & Absolute timing & $[0, \infty)$ \\
Raw Days & $hours / 24$ & Daily patterns & $[0, \infty)$ \\
Raw Weeks & $hours / (24 \times 7)$ & Weekly patterns & $[0, \infty)$ \\
Raw Months & $hours / (24 \times 30)$ & Monthly patterns & $[0, \infty)$ \\
Square Root & $\sqrt{hours}$ & Moderate compression & $[0, \infty)$ \\
Min-Max Scaling & $\frac{x - min}{max - min}$ & Cross-comparison & $[0, 1]$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Each transformation method addresses specific distribution characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Logarithmic:} Most effective for datasets with extreme right-skewness (Traffic Fines, BPI datasets)
    \item \textbf{Raw Time:} Preserves absolute temporal relationships, suitable for time-series analysis
    \item \textbf{Square Root:} Provides moderate compression for datasets with moderate skewness
    \item \textbf{Min-Max Scaling:} Enables cross-dataset comparison by normalizing to [0,1] range
\end{itemize}

The transformation selection impacts visualization effectiveness significantly. Table \ref{tab:transformation_effectiveness} shows the effectiveness of each transformation across different datasets.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Transformation Effectiveness by Dataset}
\label{tab:transformation_effectiveness}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Transformation} & \textbf{Traffic Fines} & \textbf{BPI 2012} & \textbf{BPI 2017} & \textbf{Sepsis} \\
\midrule
Logarithmic & Excellent & Good & Excellent & Good \\
Raw Hours & Poor & Fair & Poor & Excellent \\
Raw Days & Fair & Good & Fair & Good \\
Raw Weeks & Good & Excellent & Good & Fair \\
Raw Months & Excellent & Good & Good & Poor \\
Square Root & Good & Fair & Good & Good \\
Min-Max Scaling & Good & Good & Good & Good \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Interactive Visualization Design}

The violin chart implementation combines distribution visualization with statistical analysis, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:violin_example}.

\label{fig:system_ui}
\end{figure}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Violin Chart Generation]
fig = px.violin(
    df_final, 
    x='transformed_time', 
    y='concept:name',
    orientation='h',
    box=True,
    title=plot_title,
    category_orders={'concept:name': event_order}
)

# Add statistical annotations
fig.update_traces(
    meanline_visible=True,
    side='positive',
    scalemode='width'
)

# Customize layout for better readability
fig.update_layout(
    height=max(400, len(df_final['concept:name'].unique()) * 80),
    margin=dict(l=20, r=20, t=60, b=20),
    showlegend=False
)
\end{lstlisting}

The horizontal orientation was chosen to accommodate event type labels, while the integrated box plots provide statistical summaries alongside distribution shapes.

\subsection{Statistical Sorting Implementation}

Users can sort event types based on seven statistical parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Frequency (event count)
    \item Mean time
    \item Median time
    \item Minimum time
    \item Maximum time
    \item 25th percentile (Q1)
    \item 75th percentile (Q3)
\end{itemize}

This multi-parameter sorting enables comprehensive temporal analysis from different statistical perspectives.

\section{Evaluation and Discussion}
\label{sec:evaluation}

\subsection{Dataset Evaluation}

The approach was validated across four diverse process mining datasets, each representing different domain characteristics and temporal patterns. Table \ref{tab:datasets} provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset characteristics.

\begin{table}[H]

\textbf{Least Frequent Activity} & Appeal to Judge & O\_CANCELLED & O\_Cancelled & Release A \\
\textbf{Activity Frequency} & 2,665 & 5,015 & 7,635 & 365 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The datasets demonstrate significant variability in scale, complexity, and temporal characteristics:

\textbf{Traffic Fines (Government):} 150,370 cases, 561,470 events spanning up to 12 years, demonstrating long-term citizen interaction patterns with government processes.

\textbf{BPI Challenge 2012 (Finance):} 13,087 cases, 262,000 events from Dutch financial processes, showing business workflow characteristics with moderate complexity.

\textbf{BPI Challenge 2017 (Finance):} 31,509 cases, 1,202,267 events representing complex credit application processes with the highest event density.

\textbf{Sepsis Cases (Healthcare):} 1,050 cases, 15,214 events from hospital patient treatment, exhibiting time-critical medical decision patterns with the shortest overall duration but highest intensity.

\subsection{Smart Filtering Effectiveness}

The smart filtering approach demonstrated significant effectiveness across all datasets:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Smart Filtering Results}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
Dataset & Original Events & After Filtering & Reduction \\
\midrule
Traffic Fines & 561,470 & 400,659 & 28.7\% \\
BPI 2012 & 262,000 & 249,000 & 5.0\% \\

Sepsis Cases & 15,214 & 14,164 & 6.9\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The results show that filtering effectively removes uninformative events while preserving analytical validity, with reduction rates varying based on process characteristics.

\subsection{Cross-Domain Pattern Discovery}

The violin chart visualization revealed distinct temporal patterns across domains. Table \ref{tab:patterns} summarizes the key temporal characteristics discovered.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Cross-Domain Temporal Pattern Analysis}
\label{tab:patterns}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Pattern Type} & \textbf{Traffic Fines} & \textbf{BPI 2012} & \textbf{BPI 2017} & \textbf{Sepsis} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Distribution Shape} & Bimodal & Multimodal & Right-skewed & Left-skewed \\
\textbf{Peak Activity Time} & 30 days, 6 months & 2-3 weeks & 1-2 months & 2-4 hours \\
\textbf{Median Duration} & 45 days & 12 days & 35 days & 12 hours \\
\textbf{90th Percentile} & 180 days & 45 days & 120 days & 72 hours \\
\textbf{Temporal Clustering} & Strong & Moderate & Strong & Very Strong \\
\textbf{Outlier Presence} & High & Low & High & Low \\
\midrule
\textbf{Business Insights} & & & & \\
- Early Response & 25\% within 7 days & 80\% within 5 days & 40\% within 14 days & 95\% within 1 hour \\
- Late Processing & 15\% after 6 months & 5\% after 60 days & 20\% after 90 days & 2\% after 48 hours \\
- Process Efficiency & Low & High & Medium & Very High \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Detailed analysis of each domain reveals specific characteristics:

\textbf{Government Processes (Traffic Fines):} Exhibited bimodal distributions with early payment clusters and long-tail delayed responses, indicating citizen behavior variability. The presence of regulatory deadlines creates distinct temporal peaks at 30 days and 6 months.

\textbf{Financial Processes (BPI Challenges):} Showed predictable temporal stages corresponding to business process steps, with clear separation between different approval phases. BPI 2012 demonstrates more structured workflow with consistent timing, while BPI 2017 shows higher variability due to process complexity.

\textbf{Healthcare Processes (Sepsis):} Demonstrated time-critical clustering with rapid initial responses followed by gradual treatment progression. The urgent nature of medical care results in highly concentrated temporal distributions within the first few hours.

\subsection{Performance Analysis}

The system demonstrated excellent scalability and performance across all datasets. Table \ref{tab:performance} provides detailed performance metrics.

\textbf{Sort Operation (ms)} & 180 & 120 & 290 & 80 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The performance analysis reveals several key insights:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linear Scalability:} Processing time scales linearly with dataset size
